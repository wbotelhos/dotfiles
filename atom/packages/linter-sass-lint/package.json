It will be used with files that have the “Sass” or “SCSS” syntax.\n\n[sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) is a node only sass linter and isn't related to [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint).\n\n### Installation\n\nYou'll need to have [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) installed to use this plugin\n\n**The current latest version of [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) comes bundled with this plugin but if you'd like to install it manually you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).**\n\n#### Plugin installation\n\n```\napm install linter-sass-lint\n```\n\n#### .sass-lint.yml\n\nA `.sass-lint.yml` config file is required for this linter. You can find an example of one [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/blob/master/lib/config/sass-lint.yml) and documentation on how to configure this and each of the rules [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs).\n\nBy default this plugin will search up the directory tree for this file, you can also specify a path to this config file in the plugin settings or in `~/.atom/config.cson` file. Usually you would place this config file in your projects root and keep it under version control too.\n\nYou can use the `noConfigDisable` option to prevent any attempts at linting (and the missing config error messages you will encounter) if a valid config is not found.\n\nBy default a config file found in the root of your currently open project will take preference over a config file specified with the `configFile` option.\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are three options you can configure either within the plugin or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file.\n\n* `noConfigDisable` - Enable to prevent any linting if a valid config file (`.sass-lint.yml`) is not found in the project root.\n\n* `configFile` - this is path to a `.sass-lint.yml` config file, this should only be used if you'd like to specify a global config file rather than rely on a project config file in the root of your project.\n\n* `globalNodePath` This is where you can set your global node installation path. Run `npm get prefix` and paste the result here. This will be where `linter-sass-lint` will then search for the globally installed version of `sass-lint` if you choose to enable this with `globalSassLint`.\n\n* `globalSassLint` This allows you to specify that you want to use your globally installed version of `sass-lint` (`npm install -g sass-lint`) instead of the version bundled with `linter-sass-lint`.\n\n* `resolvePathsRelativeToConfig` This option allows you to choose to resolve file paths relative to your config file rather than relative to the root of your currently open project.\n\n### Extra File Extensions\n\nThis plugin will attempt to lint a file with framework specific file extensions on top of the usual `.scss` and `.sass` extensions such as with shopify's `.scss.liquid` extension as long as you still include `.scss` or `.sass` somewhere in the file, you must also ensure that the Atom grammar scope for that file is set to either SCSS or Sass depending on which it corresponds to.\n\nThis does not mean that sass-lint will be able to definitely parse any sort of non standard SCSS or Sass code and if you use any platform specific code in the file it will almost definitely produce a parse error. Sass-lint will not be moving to support any use of non standard language outside of the Sass spec.\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions, suggestions and fixes are more than welcome.\n\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidlines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nA general sense of the guidelines can be found below.\n\n1. Indentation is 2 spaces.\n1. All code should pass the coffeelinter linter, the config of which is included in this repository (`npm-test`).\n1. the .editorconfig file should be used to ensure a consistent style [info here](http://editorconfig.org/)\n\nGeneral contribution guidelines apply\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository\n1. Create a feature/hotfix branch off of master\n1. Lint your code `npm-test`\n1. Commit and push the branch\n1. Make a pull request\n\nIf you're unsure on whether your contribution will be required then please file an issue first and we can discuss it.\n\nIf you find any problems with the `sass-lint` itself with regards to bugs in rules then please visit the [sass-lint Github Page](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) please note that `sass-lint` is young and still under heavy development.\n",
